          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Collaboration is a key part of the success of any organization,
            executed through a clearly defined vision and mission and based on
            transparency and constant communication.

          <h3>Vission</h3>
          <p>
            Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just
            passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.

            burning desire to do things – you don’t have enough goals." –Lou
